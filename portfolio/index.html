			<p>
				Welcome to my portfolio! <br>
				I have had some accomplishments when it comes to computer science over the 6 years since I took a processing.js course on Khan Academy. <br>
				I decided that I wanted to list these accomplishments somewhere for colleges and employers to view; therefore, this part of my website exists.
			</p>

			<h1 id = "tmbww">Turing Machine But Way Worse</h1>
			<p>
				In 2018 I got more interested in a niche in the realm of computer science: esoteric programming languages. <br>
				Esolangs, short for esoteric programming languages, are programming languages made for a purpose other than to be of practical use. <br>
				These esolangs could be cool, like Bitwise Cyclic Tag, an esolang that is Turing Complete with only <i>two</i> commands, or compact, like 05AB1E, Jelly, GolfScript, and Japt, or plainly humorous, like Half-Broken Car in Heavy Traffic.<br>
				I tried making one of these, and ended up with Turing Machine But Way Worse: an esolang meant to be as similar to a Turing Machine while supporting output.

				</div>

			<p>
				In 2020 I reflected back on Turing Machine But Way Worse and realized that it was pretty unsatisfactory. <br>
				It only supported two symbols, 0 and 1, its I/O was hacky and not in the spirit of a Turing Machine. <br>
				So I fixed these issues, and over the course of multiple months, finished the esolang.
