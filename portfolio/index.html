		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			Welcome to my portfolio! <br>
			I have had some accomplishments when it comes to computer science over the 6 years since I took a processing.js course on Khan Academy. <br>
			I decided that I wanted to list these accomplishments somewhere for colleges and employers to view; therefore, this part of my website exists.

		<h1>Turing Machine But Way Worse</h1>
		<p>
			In 2018 I got more interested in a niche in the realm of computer science: esoteric programming languages. <br>
			Esolangs, short for esoteric programming languages, are programming languages made for a purpose other than to be of practical use. <br>
			These esolangs could be cool, like Bitwise Cyclic Tag, an esolang that is Turing Complete with only <i>two</i> commands, or compact, like 05AB1E, Jelly, GolfScript, and Japt
