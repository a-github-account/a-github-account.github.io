		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			Welcome to my portfolio! <br>
			I have had some accomplishments when it comes to computer science over the 6 years since I took a processing.js course on Khan Academy. <br>
			I decided that I wanted to list these accomplishments somewhere for colleges and employers to view; therefore, this part of my website exists.
